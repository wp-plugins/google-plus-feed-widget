Put this in your plugins dir, enable the plugin.
Go to the widgets page, and drag to the place you want. By default it uses my own google+ id until you edit that, this is easily fixed in the drop down.
You can get your Google+ id from the address bar when you go to your Google+ profile


Hope you enjoy this plugin until the API comes out, feel free to let me know any bugs or patches you might have
